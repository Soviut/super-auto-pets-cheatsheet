### Type Support For `.vue` Imports in TS

Since TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports, they are
shimmed to be a generic Vue component type by default. In most cases this is
fine if you don't really care about component prop types outside of templates.
However, if you wish to get actual prop types in `.vue` imports you can enable
Volar's `.vue` type support plugin by running `Volar: Switch TS Plugin on/off`
from VSCode command palette.
